This project is just getting off the ground and could use some help with cleaning things up and refactoring.

If you want to contribute - we'd love it! Just open an issue to work against so you get full credit for your fork. You can open the issue first so we can discuss and you can work your fork as we go along.

If you see a bug, please be so kind as to show how it's failing, and we'll do our best to get it fixed quickly.
